# Automatic tests using Mocha

This is a very simple code in Node JS that uses Mocha to make some automatic tests. I followed the tutorial seen in [this site](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-js-and-mocha).

Tha application is a system to translate from RGB (red, green, blue) to hexadecimal color representation. If you would like to run it, type `npm start`.

Tu run the test, go to the terminal and just type `npm test`.
